## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open `home.html`** in your web browser to view the blog homepage.
3. **Navigate** using the menu to explore the About and Contact pages.

## Customization

- **Content:** Edit the HTML files (`home.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`) to add your own posts, stories, and information.

- **Branding:** Adjust colors, fonts, and styles in `style.css` to match your brand.
- **JavaScript:** Enhance or modify interactivity in `script.js` as needed.

## Accessibility & Best Practices

- Uses semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
- Keyboard navigation and focus indicators are supported.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
